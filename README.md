Abstract
This topic develops a set of robot interfaces and system processes to 
improve the traditional way doctors and professional medical teams diagnose and track children with Autism Spectrum Disorder(ASD) in the past.
Through the introduction of robot interfaces and AI technology, 
they can perform auxiliary diagnosis, thereby saving manpower and time costs. 
To reduce the clinical pressure on physicians. 

This topic has three technical parts: 
(1) Zenbo robot interactive interface process development module 
(2) Child human body posture skeleton detection AI calculation module executed on Jetson Nano edge computing 
(3) Child facial expression recognition AI calculation module for detecting concentration with eye tracking. 

This system interacts with children through the interface of Zenbo robots and interactive processes,
combined with related technologies and AI computing modules, 
to obtain the required objective diagnostic information, 
including: facial expression characteristics, eye tracking characteristics, and children's physical characteristics performance etc. 

In addition to using AI technology to analyze objective information, 
this topic also produced a scale for this process, 
the purpose of which is to collect subjective information for those who assist children to complete the process. 
Finally, the objective and subjective information is presented on the web in a data-based way to assist physicians in clinical diagnosis.
